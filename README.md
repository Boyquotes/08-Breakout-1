# E09a-Scripting

This is my 09-Juicy Breakout I changed the title in Godot but didnt change it on github.
For this prodject I felt bad for you, so to keep you awake while your grading these prodjects I updated my brakeout game with a sound track, a yell sound effect, a background, a different paddle and ball and a trick ball to make the game a bit harder. the trick ball only lasts for the first life, goes off the screen and reappers back on the screen, and cant brake any off the tiles.
